<h1>Background</h1>
<p>The exercises below are based on the following paper:</p>
<p>Green, Donald P., Tiffancy C. Davenport, and Kolby Hanson (2019). “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/XPS.2018.18">Are There Long-Term Effects of the Vietnam Draft on Political Attitudes or Behavior? Apparently Not.</a>” <em>Journal of Experimental Political Science</em>. 6(2), 71-80.</p>
<p>This paper examines the long-term effects of the Vietnam draft lottery on the political attitudes and behavior of the men who were were eligible for the draft during the period of 1969–1971. Based on birth dates, the draft lottery was used to randomly select men who turned 19 prior to 1969, 1970 and 1971 to serve in the US army. Many of those drafted did not comply with the draft and did not serve in Vietnam for various reasons, including opposition to the war. The authors use a survey and publicly available information, such as voter registration, voter records and partisan membership of eligible draftees to study whether being assigned to the draft has any long-term political effects.</p>
<p>The data set <code>draft.csv</code> contains the following variables that were obtained from surveys conducted by the authors on draft-eligible men from 2014 to 2016.</p>

<h1>Exam</h1>
<div id="question-1-5-points" class="section level2">
<h2>Question 1 (5 points)</h2>
<p>Load the data and save it as an object called <code>draft</code>. Create a barplot of the ideology variable with the heights corresponding to counts in each category. Format this plot nicely with axis labels and informative labels for each bar the on barplot.</p>
<p>NOTE: you may have to abbreviate the ideology category labels to have them all fit on the plot.</p>
</div>
<div id="question-2-2-points-code-2-points-write-up" class="section level2">
<h2>Question 2 (2 points code; 2 points write-up)</h2>
<p>Create a new binary variable, <code>liberal</code>, that is <code>1</code> if a respondent says they are liberal or very liberal and <code>0</code> otherwise. Use this variable to calculate the sample proportion of respondents that are liberal (i.e., the sample mean) by year that respondents were born in. Note that <code>ideology</code> (and thus <code>liberal</code>) has missing values in it and you should remove those observations from any calculations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tips: Use <code>mutate()</code> to add the <code>liberal</code> variable and save that new data frame as <code>draft</code> again. You should save the <code>tibble</code> resulting from your calculations of the sample means as <code>liberal_year</code>. Use <code>select()</code> to make sure this tibble only has two columns: the year and the estimated ATE. Make sure I can see the results from this <code>tibble</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Briefly interpret the result (a sentence will suffice).</p>

<div id="question-3-2-points-code-2-points-write-up" class="section level2">
<h2>Question 3 (2 points code; 2 points write-up)</h2>
<p>Events at an early stage of life can have a long-lasting impact on a person’s political perspectives. Let’s see if this is true for this setting. Estimate the sample average treatment effect of being drafted (<code>draft</code>) on being liberal (<code>liberal</code>) and save this value as <code>ate.</code></p>
<p>Report your estimate in the write-up and briefly interpret the result in a sentence.</p>

<h2>Question 4 (2 points code; 2 points write-up)</h2>
<p>Even if we assign the same treatment, respondent’s characteristics can change its effect. In this question, we focus on birth year. Estimate the sample average treatment effect of being drafted on identifying as liberal in 2014 <strong>by year of birth</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tips: save the resulting <code>tibble</code> of your code as <code>ate_year.</code></li>

<div id="question-5-2-points-write-up" class="section level2">
<h2>Question 5 (2 points write-up)</h2>
<p>Your co-workers Bobby Boxplot and Harriet Histogram are arguing about what the treatment should be in this study. Bobby says that the study should use whether the respondent actually served in Vietnam as the treatment, whereas Harriet says that it should be being drafted or not as we have done up until now. Given what you know about the setting, which of these two approaches would have higher internal validity? Discuss your reasoning briefly for your answer in two to four sentences.</p>
